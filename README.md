OpenEdge InjectABL Inversion of Control container/Dependency Injection module
===============================================================================
InjectABL is an Inversion of Control container/Dependency Injection module that was created as part of the [AutoEdge|TheFactory reference implementation](http://communities.progress.com/pcom/community/psdn/openedge/architecture/autoedgethefactory). This project breaks separates the InjectABL module from the larger AutoEdge code, and makes it available for independent use.

The InjectABL IoC component is inspired by, and largely based - conceptually and to a lesser degree code - on the [Ninject](http://wiki.github.com/enkari/ninject) DI container. While many DI/IoC products provide mapping facilities, the majority of them are XML based; Ninject starts with source code-based mappings, which can be extended to use XML. This provides more readability; in addition Ninject has usable defaults, and is relatively simple to use and understand. It is also itself easily extensible.

The [wiki](https://github.com/PeterJudge-PSC/InjectABL/wiki) contains more details.
